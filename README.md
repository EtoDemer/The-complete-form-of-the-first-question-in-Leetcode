As a beginner in coding, I have recently started learning leetcode, but the code for leetcode is mostly written as algorithm interfaces rather than complete code. Therefore, I want to supplement the algorithm interface into a complete program, which is the reason why I created this repository. I hope to improve my algorithm and code writing skills, and I will persist.
